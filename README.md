# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is a project to demonstrate base level html skills by 
creating a webpage for recipes.

Post project(thoughts):
With this project I applied the use of html templates, ordered/unordered lists, links, and
image embedding. 

This project was primarily helpful in gaining a better understanding of using git through
the command line and documenting commits.
