    <h2>Beef Stroganoff Recipe</h2>
    <p>I have been making this recipe for over 20 years. This can be served over 
        either rice or noodles. A little work but worth the effort.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 ounces butter</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced (white parts only)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared mustard</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white wine</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 
            inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef strips 
            quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly 
            for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips.
        </li>
        <li>Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth 
            and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover 
            and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.
        </li>
        <li>Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat 
            briefly then salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
